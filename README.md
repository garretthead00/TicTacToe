# TicTacToe
This repository will contain the source code to build an unbeatable AI for TicTacToe using Alpha-Beta Pruning


How to play:
The game is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe where the player will compete against an "unbeatable" AI opponent. 
The controls will be simple: Using the number pad, (0-8), each number corresponds to a grid space on the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
0 for top-left most space moving right, down to 8 for bottom-right most, respectively.

Each turn to go on until the player selects a move or the game is over. The AI will quickly respond with the best possible move to counter the current game state using the Alpha-Beta Pruning method on a Decision tree.


This program will developed by Garrett Head using Java on the NetBeans IDE 8.0.2. --5/21/2015
